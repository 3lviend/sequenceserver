h1. Simple blast search

Biologists constantly  generate new sequence data... but the people who want to access the data are often not computational, so they need some kind of point & click & copy & paste interface. It's a common issue. See for example:

Alternatives: The GMOD software can be overkill. But it's blast form is limited when dealing with several databases. All publicly available blast web wrappers are ugly and horrible for users.


The idea is to make a blast server that is simple to set up & maintain (for the administrator), and pleasant to use (by thinking for user). 


h3. Features for the admin:

 * automagic setup. "gem install" + point it at blast binaries and fasta database files --> youre good to go. (using ruby's internal Webrick server avoids overhead normally associated with admin)
 * autodetection of new blast databases


h3. Features for the user:

 * autodetection of whether the use entered nucleotide or aminoacid sequence --> dynamically updated availability of what blast methods
 * blast method implies which database can be used (dynamically updated list of available databases)
 * links in the results that let you fetch the original sequences of the database hits (by providing links to hits, and batch download of the database sequences). 



h2. requirements
* ruby 1.8.7 or later. The following ruby gems will self-install: "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ , "bio":http://bioruby.org/ .
* NCBI Blastplus: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download Old versions of NCBI blast (pre 2.2.18) are not supported.


All blast databases must be formatted. Eg: 
* *for protein:* makeblastdb -dbtype prot -title 'my ant proteins'    -in myProteinDatabase.fasta -parse_seqids
* *for nucleotide*: makeblastdb -dbtype nucl -title 'official geneset 1' -in myNucleotideDatabase.fasta -parse_seqids

h2. launching

* ruby search.rb           --> commandline will display address of web server (default: localhost:4567)


h2. FAQ:
 
*sequence retrieval doesn't work?*
  Probably because you forgot the "-parse_seqids" argument when running makeblastdb.
